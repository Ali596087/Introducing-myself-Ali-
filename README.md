<h1>Introducing Ali Haydar-Ahmad</h1>
<p> Hi my name is Ali Haydar-Ahmad and i'm from **Lebanon**! The middle school _I_ attended was "Glen Cairn" _public school_ which isn't that far from here, in fact it's **only** 2-3 minutes from here. My dad name is Youssef and my mom name is Salam and I have 2 younger sisters that goes to "John Young" _elementary school_,which is also not far from here!<p>

<p> My _interets/hobbies_ when it comes outside of school are actually a handful of stuff. To start off, I am pretty athletic and enjoy some sports from Basketball and soccer but I **mostly** love to play Basketball, I like the sport in general from watching it on tv to playing it outside, and I gotta say that my favourite NBA player
